Pinterest-style app for book discovery. Users curate book lists of books they love, which other users can browse—and purchase though affiliate links—in an image-centric UI that tries to capture the feel of browsing through a physical book store.

By Its Cover was my final project for Launch Academy. I am currently rebuilding it from the ground up to show how I have advanced in the last year and a half. The rebuild isn't ready to deploy yet, but you can see the original [on Heroku](http://byitscover.herokuapp.com/).

Although this project has been on hold for awhile, I'm rather proud of the `Resourceable` module I created for it. You can read an explanation [here](https://gist.github.com/philliplongman/af64f9eae57f9561f9cf6cb34610e7d3).

### Inspiration

My brother and I both discovered the same writer from the recommendation shelf at the wonderful independent Harvard Bookstore. Since then, I've embraced ebooks, but Amazon is a terrible place to find new things to read, and I miss the bookstore experience. I wanted to reduce the torrent of info on an Amazon page and make book discovery a curated experience, where you might find something you weren't looking for—like my brother and I did—instead of an algorithm recommending based on things you already liked.
