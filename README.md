By Its Cover was my final project for Launch Academy, which I am continuing to tinker with.

It's a Pinterest-style app for book discovery—meaning that users curate book lists of books they love, which other users can browse in a image-centric UI.

My brother and I both discovered the same writer from the recommendation shelf at the wonderful, independent Harvard Bookstore. Since then, I've embraced ebooks, but I hate shopping for them, and I miss the bookstore experience. I wanted to reduce the torrent of info on an Amazon page and make book discovery a curated experience—where you might find something you weren't looking for, like my brother and I did—instead of an algorithm recommending on things you already liked.
